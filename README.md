# Longstocking
The successor to Sock, a still small offering.

## Compiling (& running)
`make -jX (number of cores); ./longstocking`

## Features
* Faster instruction execution!
* More opcodes!
* ***16-bit!!!***
* registers (included: zero register, useful ARM-inspired addition)
* Use it as a library!1!!!1
* a stack is a construct commonly found in hardware/programming which allows values to be placed into and removed out of
as wished, thus allowing preservation of which could be used later at a point on a given program, granted the programmer
can administrate its size and contents with the 'stack pointer'.

## Usecases
You may not shove it into a Kubernete, Docker container, ARM Mac, or similar.

Doing so will void the nonexistent warranty.
